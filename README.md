# Bank kata

I've practiced the [bank kata](https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata) by [Sandro Mancuso](https://twitter.com/sandromancuso)

My goals where to practice a mix of outside-in + classicist mix of TDD (an idea by [Manuel Rivero](https://twitter.com/trikitrok)) 

Keeping track of the time using git commits.

## Feedback

  - The ability to refactor without breaking the tests is quite good, satisfying even
  - Testing at the almost-boundaries does not cover all the cases, but it's a step in the good direction
