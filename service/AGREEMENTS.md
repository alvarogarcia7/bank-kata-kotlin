# Working Agreements (mostly technical)

## Validation

Types of validations, that depend on the previous ones (cumulative):
  * all required values are present
    * (e.g., the account number is present)
  * values with correct format
    * (e.g., the account number follows the *[IBAN]: International Bank Account Number
  rules)
  * existing data
    * (e.g., there is an account with this number)
  * business rules
    * (e.g., this account can receive a deposit)
